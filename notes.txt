Containers are stateful components, so components created with the class
keyword or functional components using useState and components going into the
components folder are dumb or presentational components that don't manage
state


Solutions for returning adjacent JSX elements:
1. wrap them in an array and give each item a key
2. create an auxiliary higher order component

The idea behind the modal is to have a wrapping element which
provides the styling which then simply wraps itself about any
content we want to show in that modal

Arrow functions: contain the state or the context of this
